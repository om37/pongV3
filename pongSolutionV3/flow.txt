On client start:
	Create view, model and controller
	Contact server:
		Create socket (need to know server IP and Port to connect to)
		Create Player object, pass Socket to server:
			Using socket, create reader/writer to server
		Add player to model (as observer)
		Start player thread:
			Check if reader null
			If not read from reader (reader.get())
			Decode string for UI element (bats, ball) positions
			Create dummy objects and give them new coords
			Send dummy objects to model
			Call modelChanged to update observers

ClientView will wait for keypress. On keypress:
	View send keyCode to controller
	Controller decide which key is pressed
	Call relevant method on model (moveBatUp/Down)
	Model call moveBat on player object
	player.moveBat adds the direction of movement to player's writer (which has socket to server)


On server start:
	Create model
	Create server socket
